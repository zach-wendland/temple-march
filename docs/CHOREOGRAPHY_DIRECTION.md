# Temple March Sequence - Character Staging & Choreography Direction

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: December 14, 2025
**Art Director**: Temple March Project
**Status**: Production Ready

---

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the visual staging, character choreography, and scene composition for the Temple March sequence. The direction emphasizes **tragic gravitas over triumphant action** - every visual choice must communicate the weight of what is being lost, not celebrate what is being destroyed.

The sequence draws from Roman military procession aesthetics, classical tragedy staging, and the "richer period piece" visual language established by Doug Chiang for the prequel trilogy.

---

## Part I: Character Design & Movement Language

### 1.1 Anakin's Presence - "The Fallen Sun"

**Core Visual Concept**: Anakin should read as a solar eclipse - familiar light obscured by darkness, still recognizable but fundamentally changed. He is not yet the mechanical terror of Vader; he is a man committing to becoming a monster.

#### Physical Staging
- **Posture**: Rigid, military bearing replaces his typical Jedi fluidity
- **Gait**: Deliberate, metronomic steps - each footfall a choice he cannot unmake
- **Head Position**: Chin slightly elevated, eyes forward - refusing to see what he sees
- **Shoulders**: Squared, tension visible - he is carrying an invisible weight

#### The Cape
The cape is Anakin's most expressive element in the march - it does what his face cannot.

| Movement State | Cape Behavior | Emotional Subtext |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Walking forward | Smooth flow behind, slight billow | Inevitability, momentum |
| Stopping | Cape settles slowly, drapes heavily | Weight of decision |
| Turning | Dramatic sweep, follows body rotation | Power, authority |
| Combat stance | Cape thrown back, shoulder exposed | Predator revealed |
| Wind interaction | Cape pulls toward Temple | Darkness calling him |

**Technical Note**: Cape physics should favor dramatic silhouette over realistic simulation. Err toward longer settle times and more pronounced billowing.

#### Lightsaber Ready Position
Anakin's saber should NOT be ignited during the march itself. The saber remains:
- Clipped to belt during Senate departure
- In right hand, unlit, during street march
- Raised to chest level approaching stairs
- Ignited ONLY at threshold of Temple doors

The delayed ignition builds anticipation. When the blue blade finally appears, it should feel like a threshold crossed.

#### Facial Performance Direction
- **Pre-Temple**: Mask of determination, jaw clenched, occasional swallow
- **Micro-expressions**: Brief flickers of doubt immediately suppressed
- **Eyes**: Should catch light in ways that suggest tears held back
- **Never**: Snarling, sneering, or "evil" expressions - this is tragedy, not villainy

---

### 1.2 Clone Formation - "The Instrument"

**Core Visual Concept**: The 501st Legion should read as a single organism - a weapon being aimed. Individual personality is suppressed by the inhibitor chips; what remains is terrifying precision.

#### Formation Structure (Inspired by Roman Triplex Acies)

```
                    [ANAKIN]
                       |
            [Commander Appo] [Lieutenant]
                  |               |
    ============================================
    |    VANGUARD - Elite Commandos (6)       |
    |    Katarn-class armor, heavy weapons    |
    ============================================
                       |
    ============================================
    |         FIRST LINE - Riflemen (24)       |
    |    Standard 501st, DC-15A rifles         |
    |    4 ranks of 6, tight formation         |
    ============================================
                       |
    ============================================
    |        SECOND LINE - Support (18)        |
    |    DC-15S carbines, thermal detonators   |
    |    3 ranks of 6, staggered spacing       |
    ============================================
                       |
    ============================================
    |         REAR GUARD - Heavy (12)          |
    |    Z-6 rotary cannons, rocket launchers  |
    |    2 ranks of 6, wide spacing            |
    ============================================
```

#### Movement Characteristics
- **March Rhythm**: 120 steps per minute (standard military cadence)
- **Foot Synchronization**: Perfect unison, mechanical precision
- **Weapon Carry**: DC-15A rifles at port arms (diagonal across chest)
- **Head Movement**: None - forward facing only
- **Breathing**: Visible through helmet, synchronized

#### Visual Hierarchy
- **Commander Appo**: Distinctive blue pauldron, positioned at Anakin's left shoulder
- **Lieutenants**: Red rank stripes, flank positions
- **Commandos**: Katarn armor silhouette, heavier and more angular
- **Standard Troopers**: Uniform, interchangeable - this is the point

#### Formation Behavior by Scene

| Scene | Formation State | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Senate Departure | Assembly, loose | Coming together |
| Street March | Tight column, 6-wide | Urban passage |
| Stairs Approach | Expanding wedge | Tactical deployment |
| Temple Entry | Breaking into squads | Combat dispersal |
| Confrontation | Surrounding arc | Encirclement |

**Sound Design Integration**: Boot steps should be audible as a single unified THUMP, not individual footfalls. This reinforces the "single organism" concept.

---

### 1.3 Temple Defenders - "The Dying Light"

**Core Visual Concept**: The Jedi Knights defending the Temple should embody desperate heroism - not hopeless defeat, but the fierce light of those who know they will lose and choose to stand anyway.

#### Character Types and Silhouettes

**1. Temple Guards (Yellow Sabers)**
- Pike weapons create distinctive elongated silhouette
- Face-concealing masks emphasize anonymity of sacrifice
- Movement: Ceremonial precision breaking into combat fluidity
- Grouping: Pairs, back-to-back defensive positions

**2. Jedi Knights (Various Colors)**
- Form V and Form III practitioners predominant
- Robes partially discarded for mobility
- Movement: Controlled aggression, efficient strikes
- Grouping: Individual last stands or small clusters

**3. Battlemaster Cin Drallig**
- Distinguished by older age, grey hair, commanding presence
- Dual green sabers (canonical)
- Movement: All seven forms evident, adaptive mastery
- Position: Center of defensive line, directing others

#### Defensive Staging Principles

**"The Lighthouse Formation"**
Jedi defenders should be staged as points of light in increasing darkness:

```
                 TEMPLE ENTRANCE
                      |||
              [Guard] ||| [Guard]
                     \|||/
                      |||
        [Knight]------|||------[Knight]
                      |||
              [Guard] ||| [Guard]
                     /|||\
                      |||
        [Knight]------|||------[Knight]
                      |||
               [CIN DRALLIG]
                      |
                  [Padawans]
```

- Each defender creates a "zone of light" - area of safety
- As defenders fall, zones collapse toward center
- Final stand is around Drallig protecting the inner Temple

#### Movement Language - Defenders
- **Initial Stance**: Calm, centered, lightsabers raised in salute (acknowledging what comes)
- **Combat Engagement**: Explosive into fluid - show their skill
- **Under Pressure**: Increasingly desperate, wider swings, more Force use
- **Final Moments**: Transcendent calm - accepting fate, buying time

#### Key Emotional Beats
1. **Recognition**: Some defenders recognize Anakin - freeze of disbelief
2. **Denial**: "This can't be happening" - hesitation costs lives
3. **Acceptance**: Switch to combat mode, the teacher they trained with is gone
4. **Sacrifice**: Deliberate choices to die protecting others

---

### 1.4 Temple Acolytes - "The Keepers"

**CRITICAL DESIGN NOTE**: Temple Acolytes are SHORT ADULT characters with dwarf proportions. They are NOT children. This is a deliberate design choice for both narrative and ethical reasons.

#### Physical Design Specifications

**Height Range**: 3'6" to 4'2" (106-127 cm)
**Body Type**: Sturdy, broad-shouldered, short-limbed
**Proportions**: 4-head-height ratio (classic dwarf anatomy)

| Feature | Specification | Reference |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Head Size | Proportionally larger than human | Adds expressiveness |
| Torso | Barrel-chested, dense musculature | Strength despite size |
| Arms | Nearly human length, thick forearms | Functional for combat/tasks |
| Legs | Short, powerful, wide stance | Stability, groundedness |
| Hands | Large relative to arm, capable | Skilled artisans/practitioners |

#### Costume Design
- **Robes**: Simplified Jedi robes, shorter cut for mobility
- **Colors**: Cream/tan base with brown accents (traditional Padawan palette)
- **Accessories**: Utility belts with archival tools, datapad pouches
- **Footwear**: Soft-soled boots designed for Temple floors

#### Role and Function
Temple Acolytes serve as:
- Archive assistants (helping Jocasta Nu)
- Maintenance of sacred spaces
- Ceremonial support
- Junior instructors for basic Force exercises

They are NOT combat-trained. Their presence during the attack is as **victims and witnesses**, not combatants.

#### Movement Characteristics
- **Walk**: Lower center of gravity, steady, purposeful
- **Running**: Waddle suppressed - dignified urgency
- **Fear Response**: Huddling together, seeking tall defenders
- **Hiding**: Expert at small spaces, alcoves, shadows

#### Staging During Attack
Acolytes should be:
- Glimpsed fleeing in background
- Sheltering behind Knight defenders
- Pulling wounded away from combat
- NEVER directly engaged by Anakin on-screen

**Implication Over Depiction**: Their fate is understood through:
- Empty corridors after battles pass
- Abandoned belongings
- Defender desperation to protect them
- Post-sequence environmental storytelling

## Part II: Scene-by-Scene Choreography

### Scene 1: Senate Departure

**Duration**: 45-60 seconds
**Time of Day**: Late afternoon (golden hour fading)
**Location**: Palpatine's office exterior, Senate landing platform

#### Visual Composition

**Opening Frame**: Wide establishing shot of Senate building against Coruscant skyline. Late sun creates long shadows. LAAT gunships visible in distance, approaching.

**Camera Movement**: Slow dolly toward landing platform as Anakin emerges from Senate interior.

#### Staging Diagram

```
    SENATE BUILDING ENTRANCE
           ||||||||
              |
           [ANAKIN]
              |
         /    |    \
      [Clone][Clone][Clone]  <- Honor Guard (3)
              |
    =========================
    |    Landing Platform    |
    =========================
              |
         [LAAT Gunship]
              |
    -------------------------
    |  501st Assembly Area  |
    |  (60+ troops forming) |
    -------------------------
```

#### Beat-by-Beat Choreography

**Beat 1 - The Exit** (0:00-0:15)
- Anakin steps from shadow of Senate into fading light
- Camera at knee level, looking up (low angle hero shot)
- He pauses, cape settling, looks toward Temple in distance
- Temple spires visible on horizon, still lit by sun

**Beat 2 - The Assembly** (0:15-0:35)
- Cut to wide shot: 501st troops in parade formation
- Commander Appo steps forward, salutes
- Anakin descends steps, not acknowledging salute
- Troops fall into marching formation around him

**Beat 3 - The Departure** (0:35-0:60)
- Formation begins to move
- Camera rises to crane shot, following march
- Senate building recedes, Temple grows in frame
- Final frame: silhouette of column against amber sky

#### Lighting Notes
- Warm light from setting sun catches Anakin's face
- Deep shadows from Senate pillars create bars across his path
- Clone armor reflects gold/orange tones
- As scene progresses, light becomes more red/ominous

#### Sound Design Direction
- Senate interior: echoing silence, distant murmurs
- Platform: wind, gunship engines idling
- March begin: synchronized boot steps start soft, build
- Underlying: Low drone, "Anakin's Dark Deeds" motif begins

### Scene 2: March Through Coruscant Streets

**Duration**: 90-120 seconds
**Time of Day**: Dusk transitioning to night
**Location**: Processional Way, Coruscant's Temple District

#### Visual Concept: "The Parting Sea"

Citizens of Coruscant react to the march with confusion and fear. They know something is wrong but not what. The crowd parts before the column like water before a ship.

#### Camera Strategy

**Primary Approach**: Tracking shot alongside march, at citizen eye level
**Alternating**: POV shots from within formation (clone helmet view)
**Punctuation**: High overhead shots showing column cutting through urban space

#### Street Staging

```
    DIRECTION OF MARCH -->

    [Crowd][Crowd][Crowd][Crowd]     Upper Walkways (Observers)
          |     |     |     |
    ======|=====|=====|=====|======  Street Level
          |     |     |     |
       [Citizens pulling back]       Ground Level
              |     |
         [  COLUMN  ]                501st Formation
              |     |
       [Citizens pulling back]
          |     |     |     |
    ======|=====|=====|=====|======
          |     |     |     |
    [Crowd][Crowd][Crowd][Crowd]     Lower Walkways (Observers)
```

#### Citizen Reactions (Background Performance)

**Type A - Confused**
- Stop mid-stride
- Look at each other questioningly
- Step aside uncertainly

**Type B - Fearful**
- Grab children/companions
- Back away quickly
- Duck into doorways

**Type C - Defiant**
- Hold ground momentarily
- Glare at troopers
- Eventually forced aside

**Type D - Knowing**
- Former Jedi sympathizers
- Expression of dawning horror
- Flee immediately

#### Beat-by-Beat Choreography

**Beat 1 - Street Entry** (0:00-0:20)
- Column emerges from transport hub
- Street noise fades as citizens notice
- Silence spreads like a wave ahead of march

**Beat 2 - The Parting** (0:20-0:50)
- Tracking shot: camera moves with formation
- Citizens peel away on both sides
- Focus on individual faces - fear, confusion
- Child points at Anakin; parent pulls child away

**Beat 3 - Urban Canyon** (0:50-1:20)
- High overhead shot: column as dark line
- Buildings rise on both sides, creating canyon
- Temple spires grow larger ahead
- Lights beginning to glow in windows

**Beat 4 - Temple Approach** (1:20-2:00)
- Column enters Temple Plaza
- Open space reveals full scale of Temple
- Troops expand from column to wedge formation
- Anakin's pace increases slightly

#### Lighting Progression
- Scene opens: purple/blue dusk, artificial lights emerging
- Mid-scene: full urban night, neon and building lights
- Scene end: Temple floodlights illuminate plaza
- Throughout: Anakin often in pools of shadow

#### Environmental Details
- Speeder traffic re-routing above
- Security droids scanning, retreating
- Holocomm displays showing "Technical Difficulties"
- Distant sirens (response to galaxy-wide chaos)

### Scene 3: Ascending the Temple Stairs

**Duration**: 60-90 seconds
**Time of Day**: Full night
**Location**: Processional Way stairs, Temple entrance

**THE ICONIC SHOT**: This is the signature image of the sequence. Every composition choice must serve the creation of a single, unforgettable frame.

#### The Wide Shot Composition

```
                    TEMPLE FACADE
         =============================
        ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||   <- Massive Columns

             /              \           <- Stairs (12 flights)
            /                \
           /     [ANAKIN]     \
          /         |          \
         /     [Formation]      \

    =================================
    |         PLAZA FLOOR           |
    =================================
```

#### Camera Specifications for Iconic Shot

**Position**: Extremely low, ground level at base of stairs
**Lens**: 24mm wide angle (for "Superman effect" heroic distortion)
**Angle**: 15 degrees above horizon, looking up
**Frame**: Temple fills upper 2/3, stairs and figures in lower 1/3

#### Key Visual Elements

**1. Scale Hierarchy**
- Temple: Overwhelming, ancient, sacred
- Stairs: Monumental, endless-seeming
- Anakin: Small against structure, large in frame
- Clones: Mass of identical shapes

**2. Silhouette Clarity**
- Anakin's silhouette must read immediately
- Cape creating distinctive flowing shape
- Saber (still unlit) visible in hand
- Clone helmets as repeating pattern

**3. Light Direction**
- Temple lit from behind (backlight creating halo/eclipse effect)
- Stair lights from sides (uplighting figures)
- No direct front light on Anakin (keeps face in shadow)
- Clone armor catches stair lights

#### Beat-by-Beat Choreography

**Beat 1 - The Pause** (0:00-0:15)
- Column halts at stair base
- Anakin looks up at Temple (2 seconds)
- Wind catches cape (dramatic billow)
- He takes first step; formation follows

**Beat 2 - The Ascent** (0:15-0:45)
- Steady climb, military precision
- Cut between: wide shot / Anakin's feet on stairs / formation from above
- Temple grows larger as they rise
- Sound: boots on stone, wind, distant thunder

**Beat 3 - The Threshold** (0:45-0:60)
- Anakin reaches top landing
- Formation spreads behind him in arc
- He stands before the great doors
- This is the point of no return

**Beat 4 - The Ignition** (0:60-0:90)
- Close on Anakin's hand
- Thumb finds ignition switch
- Blue blade extends (2-second hum build)
- Light illuminates his face for first time
- Expression: terrible resolve
- Formation readies weapons behind

#### Specific Shot List

| Shot | Type | Duration | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| 3.1 | Wide low angle | 8s | Establish iconic composition |
| 3.2 | Medium on Anakin | 3s | The decision to ascend |
| 3.3 | Low tracking feet | 5s | Each step deliberate |
| 3.4 | Overhead crane | 10s | Formation ascending as mass |
| 3.5 | POV Anakin | 4s | Temple doors approaching |
| 3.6 | Wide side angle | 8s | Scale of procession |
| 3.7 | Close hand on saber | 3s | Pre-ignition tension |
| 3.8 | Medium Anakin face | 5s | The ignition, light on face |
| 3.9 | Wide reverse | 6s | Formation behind, Temple before |

---

### Scene 4: Entering the Temple Main Hall

**Duration**: 45-60 seconds
**Time of Day**: Night (interior)
**Location**: Great Hall of the Jedi Temple

#### Visual Concept: "The Violation"

The Great Hall should feel sacred, ancient, and utterly unprepared for what enters. The contrast between the hall's serenity and the violence that will follow must be established through staging.

#### Hall Layout for Staging

```

                   [ANAKIN ENTERS]
```

#### Interior Atmosphere

**Lighting**
- Ambient: Soft blue-white from concealed sources
- Accent: Warm light from meditation alcoves
- Shafts: Moonlight through high windows
- Emergency: Red warning lights begin (as alarm triggers)

**Activity at Entry Moment**
- 2-3 Jedi in walking meditation
- Acolytes carrying scrolls between sections
- Service droids on cleaning routines
- Temple Guards at ceremonial posts

#### Beat-by-Beat Choreography

**Beat 1 - The Doors** (0:00-0:10)
- Exterior: Anakin raises hand
- Force push sends doors crashing open
- Sound: groaning metal, echoing boom
- Interior Jedi freeze, turn toward entrance

**Beat 2 - The Entrance** (0:10-0:25)
- Anakin steps through threshold
- Blue saber casts harsh light on ancient stone
- Clone formation files in behind
- Temple Guards activate pike-sabers (yellow blades)

**Beat 3 - The Recognition** (0:25-0:40)
- Walking Jedi Knight approaches: "Anakin? What is-"
- Anakin's saber swings (off-camera completion)
- Body falls into frame
- Other Jedi ignite sabers, alarm sounds

**Beat 4 - The Dispersal** (0:40-0:60)
- Clone formation breaks into assault squads
- They spread through available corridors
- Anakin strides toward inner Temple
- Camera follows him past fallen Knight

#### Camera Strategy

**Entrance**: Wide shot from inside hall, doors bursting open, silhouette
**Recognition**: Over-shoulder from Anakin, Knight approaching
**First Kill**: Reaction shots, shadows, sound design (not explicit violence)
**Dispersal**: Tracking shot following Anakin deeper

#### Environmental Storytelling
- Interrupted meditation mats
- Dropped datapads
- Extinguished candles (Force shockwave)
- Ancient tapestries swaying from disturbance

---

### Scene 5: Confrontation with Defenders

**Duration**: 2-3 minutes
**Time of Day**: Night (interior)
**Location**: Room of a Thousand Fountains / Great Hall approaches

#### Visual Concept: "The Last Light"

This sequence presents the organized Jedi defense and its tragic failure. The staging must honor the defenders while making clear their defeat is inevitable.

#### Defender Staging - Initial Formation

```
    TEMPLE INTERIOR (Looking toward entrance)

                    [Fallen Knight]
                          |
              [Clone Squad Alpha]
                          |
            -----------------------------
           |     CHOKEPOINT DEFENSE      |
            -----------------------------
                          |
    [Guard]---[Knight]---[DRALLIG]---[Knight]---[Guard]
                          |
                   [Guard][Guard]
                          |
                    [Acolytes]
                    [Fleeing]
```

#### Defender Character Positioning

**Cin Drallig** (Center)
- Two green sabers in opening stance
- Positioned to see all approaches
- Directing others with Force communication
- Will engage Anakin personally when formation breaks

**Temple Guards** (Flanks)
- Pike-sabers create "wall" of yellow light
- Ceremonial discipline, deadly efficiency
- Will fall first to clone suppression fire

**Jedi Knights** (Support)
- Various saber colors (green, blue, one purple)
- Deflecting blaster bolts toward clones
- Attempting to buy evacuation time

#### Battle Choreography Structure

**Phase 1: Holding the Line** (0:00-0:45)
- Defenders successfully block corridor advance
- Multiple clone casualties to deflected bolts
- Anakin observes, assessing
- Drallig: "Anakin, stop this madness!"

**Phase 2: The Breach** (0:45-1:30)
- Anakin enters combat directly
- First defender falls to his blade
- Formation begins to collapse
- Clones push through opened gaps

**Phase 3: Systematic Destruction** (1:30-2:15)
- Individual Jedi engagements
- Each defender fights brilliantly, falls inevitably
- Anakin demonstrates overwhelming power
- Drallig pushes Anakin back momentarily

**Phase 4: The Final Moment** (2:15-3:00)
- Only Drallig remains standing
- Extended duel showcasing both fighters' skill
- Drallig: "You were my finest student..."
- Drallig falls
- Anakin stands alone among the fallen

#### Combat Staging Principles

**1. Skill Recognition**
Every defender should demonstrate genuine mastery before falling. This is not a massacre of incompetents - it is the destruction of capable warriors by something worse.

**2. Overwhelming Force**
Anakin should feel inevitable. His power level is visually demonstrated through:
- Simultaneous multi-opponent engagement
- Force powers used mid-saber combat
- Attacks that break through guards
- Speed that defenders cannot match

**3. Clone Integration**
Clones provide:
- Suppression fire limiting Jedi movement
- Flanking attacks during Anakin engagement
- Finishing wounded defenders (off-camera)
- Environmental pressure (thermal detonators)

**4. Sound over Sight**
The worst violence should be heard, not seen:
- Saber strikes into unseen targets
- Cries cut short
- Bodies hitting ground off-frame
- Silence after

#### Specific Duel Staging: Anakin vs. Drallig

**Opening Exchange**
- Drallig attacks first (aggressive gambit)
- Anakin blocks easily, counterstrikes
- Drallig deflects, repositions

**Mid-Duel**
- Form transitions: Drallig cycles through multiple styles
- Anakin adapts, counters each
- Drallig scores minor hit (cape, non-lethal)
- Anakin's rage increases

**Climax**
- Drallig attempts complex disarm technique
- Anakin powers through with raw strength
- Drallig's guard breaks
- Final strike (camera on Anakin's face, not impact)

**Aftermath**
- Anakin stands over fallen Battlemaster
- Deep breath, suppressing reaction
- Turns, continues into Temple
- Clone squads secure the area

## Part III: Visual Language System

### 3.1 Camera Angle Vocabulary

| Angle Type | When Used | Emotional Effect |
|------------|-----------|------------------|
| Low angle (Anakin) | March, stairs, combat | Power, threat, inevitability |
| Eye level (Defenders) | Their moments of agency | Humanity, dignity |
| High angle (Fallen) | After defeats | Vulnerability, loss |
| Dutch angle | Moments of chaos | Disorientation, wrongness |
| POV (Clone) | Combat sequences | Dehumanization, orders |
| POV (Acolyte) | Fleeing sequences | Terror, smallness |

### 3.2 Lighting Progression

The sequence uses a deliberate lighting arc:

**Scene 1 (Senate)**: Golden hour - Warm, natural, "last good light"
**Scene 2 (Streets)**: Dusk to night - Cool blues, neon warmth
**Scene 3 (Stairs)**: Night, backlit - Eclipse imagery
**Scene 4 (Hall Entry)**: Interior calm shattered by saber light
**Scene 5 (Combat)**: Red emergency lighting, saber glow, fire

### 3.3 Movement Rhythm and Pacing

**The Metronome Principle**
The 501st march establishes a baseline rhythm (120 BPM march tempo). All other movement relates to this:

- Anakin: Slightly slower (deliberate, in control)
- Defenders: Faster (desperate, reactive)
- Acolytes: Erratic (panic, fear)
- Combat: Breaks rhythm entirely (chaos)

The return to march rhythm after combat sequences creates ominous "reset" - the machine continues.

## Part IV: Technical Implementation Notes

### 4.1 Asset Requirements

**Character Models**
- Anakin: Full expression rig, cape physics, dual hand IK
- Commander Appo: Distinctive pauldron, command animations
- Clone Trooper (501st): LOD variants for crowd, hero model for close-ups
- Cin Drallig: Dual-wield rig, grey hair, aged Jedi robes
- Temple Guard: Pike-saber rig, masked helmet, ceremonial armor
- Jedi Knight (Generic): 3-4 variants, multiple saber colors
- Temple Acolyte: Short adult model, utility robes, expressive face rig

**Environment**
- Senate Platform: Landing pads, assembly area
- Coruscant Streets: Modular urban segments, crowd system
- Temple Stairs: Monumental scale, 12-flight construction
- Great Hall: Full interior, destructible elements
- Room of 1000 Fountains: Water features, vegetation, bridges

### 4.2 Animation Priorities

**Tier 1 (Must Have)**
- Anakin walk/run cycles with cape
- Anakin combat animations (Form V Djem So)
- Clone march cycle (synchronized)
- Lightsaber ignition/deactivation
- Basic death animations

**Tier 2 (Should Have)**
- Drallig dual-wield combat set
- Temple Guard pike combat
- Acolyte fleeing/hiding cycles
- Clone tactical movements (cover, breach)
- Force power visualizations

**Tier 3 (Nice to Have)**
- Unique defender death poses
- Environmental destruction reactions
- Crowd flee behaviors (streets)
- Anakin expression micro-animations

### 4.3 Performance Considerations

**Crowd Systems**
- Street scene: 200+ NPCs (use impostor system beyond 50m)
- Clone formation: 60 hero models, instanced rendering
- Temple interior: 20-30 NPCs (full behavior)

**Particle Systems**
- Lightsaber glow/trail (budget: 500 particles per blade)
- Blaster bolts (instanced, pooled)
- Dust/debris (triggered, not persistent)
- Sparks from saber contact (burst system)

**Lighting Budget**
- Real-time shadow casters: 4 maximum (Anakin, 3 key defenders)
- Saber lights: Baked falloff with dynamic hotspot
- Emergency lights: Pre-baked with flicker animation

## Part V: Emotional Guidance for Production

### The Tragedy First Principle

Every visual choice should be tested against this question: **"Does this honor the tragedy?"**

We are depicting:
- The murder of an ancient order
- The corruption of a hero
- The betrayal of trust
- The end of an age

We are NOT depicting:
- A fun action sequence
- A villain origin celebration
- Consequence-free violence
- Generic enemy destruction

### Anakin is the Villain, But...

He is a villain we understand. The staging should maintain:
- His humanity (occasional hesitation, recognition)
- His torment (visible internal conflict)
- His capability (he could stop, chooses not to)
- His tragedy (this is what he becomes, not what he wanted)

### The Defenders Deserve Dignity

Every Jedi who falls should be:
- Shown as skilled (they fought well)
- Given a moment (we see them as individuals)
- Remembered (environmental storytelling post-battle)
- Not humiliated (no gratuitous defeat poses)

### What Remains Unseen

The most horrific implications should be understood through absence:
- Empty chambers after fighting passes
- Abandoned possessions
- Defenders' last protective stances
- Silence where there should be life
